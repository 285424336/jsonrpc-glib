Version 3.27.4
==============

Changes in this release:

 • The JSONRPC_MESSAGE_NEW_ARRAY() macro was added to allow for creating
   GVariant messages that are an array.
 • A number of conformance tests were added.
 • JsonrpcClient allows for detailed signals (G_SIGNAL_DETAILED) for
   notification and handle-call signals.
 • JsonrpcServer gained new functionality to enumerate the number of
   connected clients.
 • JsonrpcClient tries to hold on to an additional reference when
   panic is called.
 • Message parsing can now support NULL strings using maybe types when
   encoding and decoding messages.

==============
Version 3.27.1
==============

Changes in this release:

 • jsonrpc-glib now uses versioning macros similar to GLib or Gtk instead
   of a custom linker script for ABI exports.

==============
Version 3.26.0
==============

Changes in this release:

 • Run test suite as part of build tooling

===============
Version 3.25.92
===============

Changes in this release:

 • Check for version-script support from linker
 • Fix impossible comparison in JsonrpcInputStream

==============
Version 3.25.3
==============

This new release of jsonrpc-glib contains a few fixes and additions.

 • Support for gtk-doc based documentation has been added. Use
   -Denable_gtk_doc=true to enable it when configuring Meson.
 • JsonrpcServer now supports a convenience API for handling incoming
   methods via jsonrpc_server_add_handler() and
   jsonrpc_server_remove_handler().
 • Support has been added to allow jsonrpc-glib to be used as a Meson
   subproject.
 • jsonrpc-version.h now generates the proper values for checking
   compile time version information.
 • Various build options were canonicalized to use _ instead of -
   as a word separator.

==============
Version 3.25.2
==============

This is the first release of jsonrpc-glib.

This is an early project, but things seem to be working well so it's time for a
release.  You can use jsonrpc-glib to create both JSON RPC clients and servers.
Additionally, it supports connection upgrades to GVariant when both sides
support it instead of JSON to reduce parser overhead and lesson the chances of
memory fragmentation.

Things to note

 • Initial release of jsonrpc-glib.
 • We'll follow the GNOME release cycle.
 • You JsonrpcClient and JsonrpcServer should handle most of what you need
 • See jsonrpc-message.h for a convenient va_args based C API.

Thanks!
