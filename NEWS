==============
Version 3.25.2
==============

This is the first release of jsonrpc-glib.

This is an early project, but things seem to be working well so it's time for a
release.  You can use jsonrpc-glib to create both JSON RPC clients and servers.
Additionally, it supports connection upgrades to GVariant when both sides
support it instead of JSON to reduce parser overhead and lesson the chances of
memory fragmentation.

Things to note

 • Initial release of jsonrpc-glib.
 • We'll follow the GNOME release cycle.
 • You JsonrpcClient and JsonrpcServer should handle most of what you need
 • See jsonrpc-message.h for a convenient va_args based C API.

Thanks!
